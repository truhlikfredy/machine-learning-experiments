This is just collection of few machine learning scripts and notebook which I experimented with.

Data are based from kaggle.com but they are the famous titanic and mnist data-sets.

# Requirements

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
```

# How to run

They are jupyter notebooks so after installing dependancies it should be enough to execute:

```
jupyter notebook
```
